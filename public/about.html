  <p>
    The fanbot has access to all transcripts available of the podcast.
    However there are some episodes for which the list of transcripts are not available.
    This means that the Fanbot (at the moment) is not capable of searching and creating a response for questions
    regarding these episodes.
  </p>
  <h4>No Memory</h4>
  <p>
    Due to the high volume of requests this tool receives and to avoid crashes the system does not keeps
    track of the full conversation history. In technical terms this means that every question you ask
    will be treated as the first one without including previous requests in the context. I hope to implement
    chat context in the near future.
  </p>
  <h4>Results</h4>
  <p>
    In order to serve to a big number of users the requests about episode's information is limited to 10 results.
    This means that the Fanbot will have access to at most 10 records for each question you ask. This will prevent
    a Fanbot's information overflow üòµ‚Äçüí´.

  <h4>You get "Sorry, I can't help with that" too often</h4>
  <p>
    The assistant is instructed to only answer questions about the podcast.
    Try to rephrase your question to include words "episode", "guest" or "podcast".
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of asking "What's the meaning of life?" try "Tell me episodes where they discussed the meaning of life" or
    "Recommdend episodes about life".

  <h1>About the project</h1>
  <p>
    This is an <a href="https://github.com/cesar-ibr/lex-fanbot">Open Source initiative</a>
    that I started by my own because I'm a big fan of the podcast.
    I don't work for the Lex Fridman Podcast and this runs with personal resources.
    If you find a bug or problem let me know by
    <a href="https://github.com/cesar-ibr/lex-fanbot/issues">opening an issue</a>
    in the project.
  </p>
  <h1>Data Analytics</h1>
  <p>
    Google Analytics is in place just to know how people use the fanbot.
    Additionaly you can see that
    <a
      href="https://github.com/cesar-ibr/lex-fanbot/blob/c631ddea94ea187efb441a6d293ef5848c50aec1/supabase/functions/classification/index.ts#L52">
      prompts get stored
    </a> with the intention to improve the classification
    of the queries and make the fanbot smarter.
